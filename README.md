# SynthesizerJS
[Live Link](https://www.symplesynth.net)

This is not a production readme, because this project is not really ready to be looked at! I'm just leaving a message for anyjob search instructors at a/A who may be looking at this, to say that I know that this project is badly incomplete and needs a lot of work before I send it out. I'm sorry I ran out of time leaving so much undone.

Here are the things I need to finish during the job search curriculum, in order of importance:

* Add title, header text, and a sidebar of information about the project
* Add labels to all the controls that explain what the user is actually doing. plan: have text appear to the right of the synth whenever the user hovers over a control that explains what that slider/menu is doing.
* Add github/linkdIn/personal links
* Redo color scheme and design, make site visually appealing
* Replace this readme with an actual production readme
* fix bug that causes instrument to often get stuck playing one note
* Add envelope and effects controls to the currently empty section of the instrument

I hope to have all of this done within the next week or so.
